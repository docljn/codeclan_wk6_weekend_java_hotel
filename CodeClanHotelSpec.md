## Weekend Homework - CodeClan Towers

You are being asked to model a hotel. This hotel will contain a collection of rooms, of different types (e.g. bedrooms, conference rooms, dining rooms). Each room will have a capacity/number, and a collection of guests. Some rooms will also have a daily/nightly rate. The hotel will also be able to check guests in/out of rooms. Bedrooms will have a type (Single/Double).  

You will need to:

1. Create a Room superclass which contains the properties/methods common to all Rooms. 
	-  name: string
	- capacity: integer
	- chargeable: boolean

2. Create different types of rooms which inherit from the Room superclass and have properties/methods of their own, e.g. 
	- bedroom which have a room number, a type e.g. Single/Double (___HINT___ you may wish to use an enum for this with each entry having a value for the room capacity), 
	- conference rooms which have a name etc. 
	- Some rooms e.g. bedrooms, conference rooms, will be chargeable while others (e.g. dining rooms) may not.
	
3. Create a Guest class so that guests can be checked in/out of rooms.

4. Create a Hotel class, which has a collection of rooms, of different types. The hotel should be able to: 
	- check guests in/out of rooms,
	- check which guest(s), if any, are checked into a particular room.


### Possible Extensions

1. Add functionality to the hotel so it can see a list of vacant bedrooms.
2. Add functionality to check in guests to bedrooms for a number of nights.
3. Any other extensions you may wish to add.

#### Remember
Use TDD, with separate test files for each class.
